  "pqr_answer_li": "a) As a management tool to improve through indicators",
  "pqr_answer_li_2": "b) As an on-demand operational force to complete your tasks",
  "pqr_question_2": "How does CIOM help me improve my indicators?",
  "pqr_answer_2_li": "(1) It provides you with a tool for SIMPLE and DYNAMIC indicators",
  "pqr_answer_2_li_1": "(2) Allows your team, suppliers, or third parties to take measurements to feed the indicators.",
  "pqr_answer_2_li_2": "(3) Enables you to easily see improvement opportunities.",
  "pqr_answer_2_li_3": "(4) The platform has the capability to inform responsible parties of their opportunities.",
  "pqr_question_3": "Between Auditing and Inspection, what would you recommend?",
  "pqr_answer_3": "Inspections are much more friendly. While they may cause a bit more anxiety for the team since they cannot provide input, they ultimately remove the greater stress of making the responsible party feel bad throughout the auditing process. From our perspective, inspections are more objective, straightforward, and allow the team to focus on improvement opportunities rather than explanations or justifications for why things are not as they should be. Both will help improve your company.",
  "pqr_question_4": "What is the difference between Auditing and Inspection?",
  "pqr_answer_4": "Auditing tends to be a bit deeper or more probing. In an Audit, the responsible party is generally asked to accompany the Auditor during the Audit to observe opportunities and take note of improvements to be made. An Inspection, on the other hand, gives the inspector the freedom to review independently and produce the necessary information. This way, the inspector can identify opportunities more quickly and simply, so the responsible party and the team can later be informed of the identified opportunities.",
  "pqr_question_5": "What does Measure | Correct | Improve involve?",
  "pqr_answer_5": "This is a methodology widely used by successful companies. It involves identifying a critical variable for your business and creating an indicator that will allow you to manage towards the necessary improvement for the growth of your company. These indicators are fed with information that can come from measurements or your own system.",
  "pqr_question_6": "Do I need to use CIOM?",
  "pqr_answer_6_li": "If you have initiatives that you cannot carry out due to lack of time, money, or capability",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_1": "If your management indicators are all above 90% effectiveness.",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_2": "If everything seems fine, but you know it's not all right",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_3": "If you think you have vanity metrics",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_4": "CIOM is the next step in the growth of your company",
  "pqr_question_7": "What is the benefit of an on-demand operational force?",
  "pqr_answer_7": "There are likely countless initiatives that you cannot carry out due to time, money, geography, climate, etc. An on-demand operational force with today's technology allows you to have that extra hand whenever you need it. Make your ideas a reality, invest in Crowdsourcing, and forget about hiring, firing, and managing staff.",
  "pqr_question_8": "When to use Crowdsourcing?",
  "pqr_answer_8_li": "When you want your team to stop having the difficult task of being Judge and Party.",
  "pqr_answer_8_li_1": "When more objectivity and impartiality in measurements are needed.",
  "pqr_answer_8_li_2": "When you seek to increase information traceability.",
  "pqr_question_9": "What do I gain from using Crowdsourcing?",
  "pqr_answer_9_li": "Costs, risks, downtime, etc. are eliminated.",
  "pqr_answer_9_li_1": "Operational stress of leading, supervising, and executing measurements/surveys disappears.",
  "pqr_answer_9_li_2": "Develops a network of suppliers that will allow you to reach operational levels never before thought possible.",
  "pqr_question_10": "What is the disadvantage of the Crowdsourcing model?",
  "pqr_answer_10": "Since the person who measures/surveys is external, they are not affected by the result. This makes the data objective, cold, and direct. This can be stressful at first for organizations that were used to measuring internally, where the...",
  "pqr_question_11": "Will these people work for me?",
  "pqr_answer_11": "In principle, NO. The platform makes available tasks for you and all other companies. They are service providers who do not come into contact with you. Additionally, unless necessary or specified, the people do not know for whom the task they are performing is intended.",
